# ractive-promise-alt

Adaptor for Ractive that allows you to watch for a promise's status. This is an
alternate adaptor to [Ractive-adaptors-Promise].

```js
/* here's a function that returns a promise. */
function getUser() {
  return $.get('/api/user');
}

r = new Ractive({
  adapt: ['promise-alt']
});

/* you'll then be able to consume the promise via ractive.set. */
r.set('user', getUser());
```

In your template, you'll be able to inspect the promise's result (on success) or
error message (on reject). You'll also be able to figure out the status of the promise.

```html
<div>
  {{#user}}
    {{#pending}}
      Loading...
    {{/pending}}

    {{#result}}
      Hello, {{first}} {{last}}!
    {{/result}]

    {{#error}}
      An error occured: {{.}}
    {{/error}}
  {{/user}}
</div>
```

### API

This adaptor sets the following keys:

 * `pending` - this will be `true` if the promise is still being processed.
 * `result` - this will be the result of a successful promise. it will be absent
 in the case of an error.
 * `error` - this will be the result of a failing promise.
 * `progress` - if the promise emits a progress update, the progress is reported
 here.

### Usage

No need to consume the return value.

```js
require('ractive-promise-alt');
```
